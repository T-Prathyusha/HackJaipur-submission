# WANG REDA

Mistakes of violating social distancing are often committed without consciousness. 
It is very much required to look for a feasible method to deal with the same by employing a bot to monitor the social distancing and spread awareness among the human community. 

OBJECTIVES:

● To create a Conversational Robot which can interact with people through Speech (NLP).

● A robot that can warn people when Social Distancing is not maintained -Using openCV and implementing YOLO to train a program to detect if
Social Distancing is being followed.

● The concept of sending out a mini Robot which can travel to that designated place and read out a warning to them to follow Social
Distancing.

● Training the Robot using Dialog Flow to reply to people’s queries and search and give the necessary answer required.

● The trained conversational chatbot is implemented with Google Assistant so that people can converse with the bot to get the necessary
information/report something at the ease of their hand.

● To create a website for the robot where users are given access to all the recorded data about violation of physical distancing.

● The authentication of the users to log onto the website is handled by Auth0.

● The website has a histogram showing the count of violations everyday and a gallery to display the images captured by the robot while
monitoring.

● A table created on the website lists all the suspects and their details reported by the users to the chatbot.
